    """
    A registration backend which follows a simple workflow:

    1. User signs up, inactive account is created.

    2. Email is sent to user with activation link.

    3. User clicks activation link, account is now active.

    Using this backend requires that

    * ``registration`` be listed in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
      (since this backend makes use of models defined in this
      application).

    * The setting ``ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS`` be supplied, specifying
      (as an integer) the number of days from registration during
      which a user may activate their account (after that period
      expires, activation will be disallowed).

    * The creation of the templates
      ``registration/activation_email_subject.txt`` and
      ``registration/activation_email.txt``, which will be used for
      the activation email. See the notes for this backends
      ``register`` method for details regarding these templates.

    Additionally, registration can be temporarily closed by adding the
    setting ``REGISTRATION_OPEN`` and setting it to
    ``False``. Omitting this setting, or setting it to ``True``, will
    be interpreted as meaning that registration is currently open and
    permitted.

    Internally, this is accomplished via storing an activation key in
    an instance of ``registration.models.RegistrationProfile``. See
    that model and its custom manager for full documentation of its
    fields and supported operations.
    
    """
    def register(self, request, **kwargs):

        Given a username, email address and password, register a new
        user account, which will initially be inactive.

        Along with the new ``User`` object, a new
        ``registration.models.RegistrationProfile`` will be created,
        tied to that ``User``, containing the activation key which
        will be used for this account.

        An email will be sent to the supplied email address; this
        email should contain an activation link. The email will be
        rendered using two templates. See the documentation for
        ``RegistrationProfile.send_activation_email()`` for
        information about these templates and the contexts provided to
        them.

        the activation email is sent, the signal
        ``registration.signals.user_registered`` will be sent, with

        Remove expired instances of ``RegistrationProfile`` and their

        Accounts to be deleted are identified by searching for
        instances of ``RegistrationProfile`` with expired activation
        keys, and then checking to see if their associated ``User``
        instances have the field ``is_active`` set to ``False``; any

        key will be deleted.
        
        It is recommended that this method be executed regularly as
        part of your routine site maintenance; this application
        provides a custom management command which will call this
        method, accessible as ``manage.py cleanupregistration``.
        
        Regularly clearing out accounts which have never been
        activated serves two useful purposes:
        
        1. It alleviates the ocasional need to reset a
           ``RegistrationProfile`` and/or re-send an activation email
           when a user does not receive or does not act upon the
           initial activation email; since the account will be
           deleted, the user will be able to simply re-register and
           receive a new activation key.
        
        2. It prevents the possibility of a malicious user registering
           one or more accounts and never activating them (thus
           denying the use of those usernames to anyone else); since
           those accounts will be deleted, the usernames will become
           available for use again.
        
        This method respects inactive ``User``s whose associated
        ``RegistrationProfile`` has been marked as activated. In this case,
        only the ``RegistrationProfile`` will be deleted, leaving the inactive
        ``User`` (and related data) in place.
